client
======
The wire protocol API for client communication with a Railgun cluster.

NOTE: all modules here are generated from the protocol buffers code found in `protobuf/client`. The only exceptions to this are files suffixed with `_ext.rs`, which are extensions to the generated code, and `mod.rs`. Do not modify the generated code by hand.
