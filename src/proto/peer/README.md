internal
========
The wire protocol API for internal peer to peer communication.

NOTE: all modules here are generated code from the protocol buffers code found in `protobuf/internal`. The only exceptions to this are files suffixed with `_ext.rs`, which are extensions to the generated code; and `mod.rs`. Do not modify the generated code by hand.
