Events are everywhere. Everything is an event. As the industry has continued to work with event-driven data streams, we've accumulated many best practices on how to model our data in a reliable, extensible, and intuitive way. CloudEvents is at the heart of this movement, and also happens to be at the very core of Hadron.

Everything in Hadron is an event, a CloudEvents 1.0 event. Streams, Pipeline inputs and outputs, ephemeral messages, everything in Hadron is built around the CloudEvents model.

#### Ease of Use
Hadron events are well-structured, easy to analyze, and prime for automation and application usage.

#### Interoperable
Hadron is positioned from the very beginning to integrate seamlessly with the greater event-driven ecosystem.

#### Ready to Go
Hadron clients speak CloudEvents fluently. Publishing data to, and consuming data from Hadron is clear, concise, and covers a wide range of applications.
