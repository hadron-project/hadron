Events are everywhere. Everything is an event. As humans have continued to work with event-driven data streams, we've accumulated many best practices on how to model our data in a reliable, extensible, and intuitive way. CloudEvents is at the heart of this movement, and also happens to be at the very core of Hadron.

Everything in Hadron is an event, a CloudEvents 1.0 event. Streams, Pipelines and all of their inputs and outputs for workflow orchestration, ephemeral messages, everything in Hadron is built around the CloudEvents model.

### Clear
Hadron events are clear, easy to analyze, and prime for automation and application usage.

### Interoperable
Hadron is positioned from the very beginning to integrate seamlessly with the greater event-driven ecosystem.

### Ready to Go
Hadron clients speak CloudEvents fluently. Publishing data to, and consuming data from Hadron is clear, concise, and has broad general purpose application.
