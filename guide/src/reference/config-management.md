<!-- Config Management
=================
- Hadron does not use config files.
- Only env vars are used for config. If a file is needed, the `.env` file paradigm may be used.
- Config is idempotent, and many config options will only ever be used/evaluated when a node is coming online for the first time.
- Nodes should only ever need to be restarted for upgrading the version of Hadron or for major config changes. -->
